<li><p>Picture it! Draw a diagram to represent the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>What do we know? Make a list of all quantities you are given in the problem, choosing clearly defined variable names for them. If a quantity is changing (a rate), then it should be labeled as a derivative.</p></li>
<li><p>What do we want to know? Make a list of all quantities to be determined. Again, choose clearly defined variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>How are the variables related to each other? Find an equation that relates the variables whose rates of change are known to those variables whose rates of change are to be found.</p></li>
<li><p>How are the rates related? Differentiate implicitly with respect to time. This will give an equation that relates the rates together.</p></li>
<li><p>Time to evaluate! Evaluate the derivatives and variables at the information relevant to the instant at which a certain rate of change is sought.</p></li>
