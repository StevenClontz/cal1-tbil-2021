  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we will discuss the relationship between antiderivatives and solving simple differential equations.  A differential equation is an equation that has a derivative.  For this section we will focus on differential equations of the form 
        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x).</me>
        Our goal is to find a relationship of <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies the differential equation.  We can solve for <m>y(x)</m> by finding the antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
