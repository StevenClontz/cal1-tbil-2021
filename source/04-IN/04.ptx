  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we will discuss the relationship between antiderivatives and solving simple differential equations.  A differential equation is an equation that has a derivative.  For this section we will focus on differential equations of the form 
        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x).</me>
        Our goal is to find a relationship of <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies the differential equation.  We can solve for <m>y(x)</m> by finding the antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>.

<statement>
    <p>Which of the following equations for <m>y(x)</m> satisfies the differential equation <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2+2x</me>.</p>

    <statement>
    <p> In <xref ref = "activity-in-ivp-1"/> there are more than one solution that satisfies the differential equation.  In fact their is a family of functions that satisfies the differential equation, that is
        <me>f(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + x^2 + c_1,</me>
        where <m>c_1</m> is an arbitrary function yet to be defined.  To find <m>c_1</m> we have to have some initial value for the differential equation, <m>y(x_0) = y_0</m>, where the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is the starting point for the differential equation.  In general this section we will focus on solving initial value problems (differential equation with an initial condition) of the form,
        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x), \;\;\; y(x_0) = y_0.</me>
