      In addition to asking <em>whether</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing,
      it is also natural to inquire <em>how</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing.
      There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval,
      as pictured in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>:
      the function can increase more and more rapidly,
      it can increase at the same rate,
      or it can increase in a way that is slowing down.
      Fundamentally,
      we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends,
      with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all.
      More than this,
      we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.

    <p permid="mwC">
      On the leftmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve.
      As we move from left to right,
      the slopes of those tangent lines will increase.
      Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing,
      and this explains why we say this function is
      <em>increasing at an increasing rate</em>.
      For the rightmost graph in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      observe that as <m>x</m> increases,
      the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease.
      This function is <em>increasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="SDL">
      Similar options hold for how a function can decrease.
      Here we must be extra careful with our language,
      because decreasing functions involve negative slopes.
      Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language.
      For example, it can be tempting to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is bigger than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      But we must remember that <q>greater than</q>
      describes how numbers lie on a number line:
      <m>x \gt y</m> provided that <m>x</m> lies to the right of <m>y</m>.
      So of course, <m>-100</m> is less than <m>-2</m>.
      Informally, it might be helpful to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is more negative than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      When a function's values are negative,
      and those values get more negative as the input increases,
      the function must be decreasing.
    </p>

      <caption>From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_6_3optsd" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="yKU">
      Now consider the three graphs shown in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref>.
      Clearly the middle graph depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate.
      Now, on the first curve, draw a sequence of tangent lines.
      We see that the slopes of these lines get less and less negative as we move from left to right.
      That means that the values of the first derivative,
      while all negative, are increasing,
      and thus we say that the leftmost curve is
      <em>decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eSd">
      This leaves only the rightmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref> to consider.
      For that function,
      the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval,
      but as we move from left to right,
      the slopes get more and more negative.
      Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing,
      and we say that the function is
      <em>decreasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="KZm">
      We now introduce the notion of <em>concavity</em>
          <idx><h>concavity</h></idx>
      which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors.
      When a curve opens upward on a given interval,
      like the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> or the exponential growth function <m>y = e^x</m>,
      we say that the curve is <em>concave up</em> on that interval.
      Likewise, when a curve opens down,
      like the parabola <m>y = -x^2</m> or the opposite of the exponential function <m>y = -e^{x}</m>,
      we say that the function is <em>concave down</em>.
      Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.
    </p>

    <p permid="rgv">
      In <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref>,
      we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each.
      On the lefthand plot, where the function is concave up,
      observe that the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and 
      the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right.
      In other words,
      the function <m>f</m> is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is increasing on that interval.
      Similarly, on the righthand plot in <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref>,
      where the function shown is concave down,
      we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve,
      and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right.
      The fact that its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is decreasing makes <m>f</m> concave down on the interval.

            and <m>11\lt t\lt 12</m> because the curve
            <m>y = s(t)</m> is concave down which corresponds to a decreasing first derivative <m>y =s'(t)</m>.
            On the intervals <m>2\lt t\lt 3</m>, <m>5\lt t\lt 7</m>,
            and <m>9\lt t\lt 10</m>,
            the position function <m>y = s(t)</m> is constant,
            and thus linear, so neither concave up nor concave down.  This also corresponds to the velocity being constant (since <m>v(t) = s'(t) = 0</m>) on these intervals.

            Since <m>a(t)</m> is the instantaneous rate of change of <m>v(t)</m>,
            <m>a(t) = v'(t)</m>.
            And because <m>v(t) = s'(t)</m>,
            it follows that <m>a(t) = v'(t) = [s'(t)]' = s''(t)</m>,
            so acceleration is the second derivative of position.
