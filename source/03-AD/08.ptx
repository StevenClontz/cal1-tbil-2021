    According to U.S.<nbsp />postal regulations,
    the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches,
    where by <q>girth</q> we mean the perimeter of the smallest end.
    What is the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail?
    What are the dimensions of the package of largest volume?

          Let <m>x</m> represent the length of one side of the square end and <m>y</m> the length of the longer side.

          What is the quantity to be optimized in this problem?
          Find a formula for this quantity in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The problem statement tells us that the parcel's girth plus length may not exceed 108 inches.
          In order to maximize volume,
          we assume that we will actually need the girth plus length to equal 108 inches.
          What equation does this produce involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Solve the equation you found in (c) for one of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>
          (whichever is easier).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Now use your work in (b) and (d) to determine a formula for the volume of the parcel so that this formula is a function of a single variable.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Over what domain should we consider this function?
          Note that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> must be positive;
          how does the constraint that girth plus length is 108 inches produce intervals of possible values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Find the absolute maximum of the volume of the parcel on the domain you established in (f) and hence also determine the dimensions of the box of greatest volume.
          Justify that you've found the maximum using calculus.

              Draw a picture and introduce variables.
              It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.
              Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step.
              Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation.

              Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.
              Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced:
              one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought,
              and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.

              Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized;
              this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.
              For example, in <xref ref="activity-ad8-1">Activity </xref>,
              we initially found that <m>V = x^2 y</m>,
              but then the additional relationship that <m>4x + y = 108</m>
              (girth plus length equals 108 inches)
              allows us to relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and thus observe equivalently that <m>y = 108-4x</m>.
              Substituting for <m>y</m> in the volume equation yields <m>V(x) = x^2(108-4x)</m>,
              and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable <m>x</m>.

              Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.
              Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.
              Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.
            </p>

          <li permid="HCD">
            <p permid="EHX">
              Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.
              This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first.
              Then, depending on the domain,
              we either construct a first derivative sign chart
              (for an open or unbounded interval)
              or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers
              (for a closed, bounded interval),
              using ideas we've studied so far.

              Finally, we make certain we have answered the question:
              does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
              or the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
              That is,
              finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.
