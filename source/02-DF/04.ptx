              The product rule is a powerful tool, but sometimes it isnâ€™t necessary; a more elementary rule may suffice. Which of the following products could you find the derivative of without using the product rule? Select all that apply.

              We have found the derivatives of <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m>, but what about the other trigonometric functions? It turns out that the quotient rule along with some trig identities can help us! (See <url href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/trig-equations-and-identities/using-trig-identities/a/trig-identity-reference"/> for a reminder of the reciprocal and Pythagorean identities.)

               Consider the function <m>f(x) = \tan x </m>, and remember that
    <m>\tan x  = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}</m>.
