    <remark>
  <p> We've learned a lot of rules for derivatives - constant multiple, sum, difference, power, trig, product, quotient, and chain. Now we need to be sure we can take the derivative of a function that might have some of these situations mixed together. </p>

<p>Whenever you are given a function and asked to find its derivative, you should first analyze what's going on in that function. Questions you might ask yourself include (but are not limited to):
   <ol>
        <li> What's the big picture? What kind of function is this?</li>
        <li>Where do you start?  </li>
        <li>Is there an easier or better way to write the function?  </li>
        <li> Are there products or quotients involved? </li>
        <li> Is it a composition of two (or more) functions? </li>
        <li> Is there a chain rule involved? If so, what are the outside and inside functions?  </li>
        <li>What types of derivatives rules will I have to use along the way? </li>
    </ol>
     </p>

 <introduction>
  <p> Consider the function <m>f(x)=x^3\sqrt{3-8x^2}</m>.</p>
   
</introduction> 
   <task><p>
       You will need multiple derivative rules to find <m>f'(x)</m>. Which rule would need to be used first? In other words, what is the big picture here? 
       <ol label="A">
           <li>Chain rule</li>
           <li>Power rule</li>
           <li>Product rule</li>
           <li>Quotient rule</li>
           <li>Sum and difference rule</li>
            </ol>
        </p></task>
 
        <task><p>
         What other rules would be needed along the way? Select all that apply.
       <ol label="A">
           <li>Chain rule</li>
           <li>Power rule</li>
           <li>Product rule</li>
           <li>Quotient rule</li>
           <li>Sum and difference rule</li>
            </ol>
        </p></task>
     
     <task>Write an outline of the steps needed if you were asked to take the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>.</task>
