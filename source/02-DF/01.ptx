                <p> In this activity you will study the velocity of a ball falling under gravity. The height of the ball is given by the formula
<m> f(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2</m>. For your convenience, below you will find a table of values for <m>f(t)</m>. Recall that the average velocity is given by the change in height over the change in time.
