            When studying functions in algebra, we often focused on the <em>value</em> of a function given a specific <m>x</m>-value. For instance, finding <m>f(2)</m> for some function <m>f(x)</m>. In calculus, and here in <xref ref="activity-limits-graphically1"/> and <xref ref="activity-limits-graphically2"/>, we have instead been exploring what is happening as we <em>approach</em> a certain value on a graph.  This concept in mathematics is known as finding a limit.

            <p>    In this activity we will explore a mathematical theorem, the Squeeze Theorem. Here is the statement of the theorem.

             <statement> 
             <p> Suppose that: </p> 
             <ul>
                  <li> <p> for an interval around <m>x=a</m>, we have that <m>f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x) </m> ;</p></li>
                  <li> <p> the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> of <m> f(x) </m> is equal to the same value <m>L</m> as the limit of <m>h(x)</m>, so <m>\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L =\lim_{x\to a} h(x) .</m></p></li>
             </ul>
<p>Then, the limit of <m>g(x)</m> as <m>x \to a</m> is also <m> L</m>, so <m>\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = L </m> </p></statement> </theorem>

            <statement>
                <p> The part of the theorem that starts with “Suppose…” forms the assumptions of the theorem, whilst the part of the theorem that starts with “Then…” is the conclusion of the theorem. What are the assumptions of the Squeeze Theorem? What is the conclusion?

        <task>
            <statement>
                <p> The assumptions of the Squeeze Theorem can be restated informally as “the function <m>g</m> is squeezed between the functions <m>f</m> and <m> h</m> around <m>a</m>”. Explain in your own words how the two assumptions result into a “squeezing effect”.
