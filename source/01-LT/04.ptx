    <p>A continuous function is one whose values change smoothly, with no jumps or gaps in the graph. We'll explore the idea first, and arrive at a mathematical definition soon.</p>

    <remark>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> exists but is not equal to <m>f(a)</m>, we say that <m>f</m> has a <term>removable discontinuity</term> at <m>x = a</m>. This is because if <m>f(a)</m> were redefined to be equal to <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m>, the redefined function would be continuous at <m>x = a</m>, thus <q>removing</q> the discontinuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the left and right limit exist separately, but are not equal, the discontinuity is not removable and is called a <term>jump discontinuity</term>.
